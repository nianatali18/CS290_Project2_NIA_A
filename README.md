# CS290_Project2_NIA_A

Again create a design for a web app that you would want to use!
Note: This can be a redesigned version of your first design.  I expect more details in these designs as we move forward.

Create a simple webpage (HTML can be simple, but include enough to show off your CSS styles) that attempts to apply some style from your design to the HTML; 

Be sure to include at least the following CSS properties:
- class attribute

- class selector

- id attribute

- id selector

- role attribute

- attribute selectors

- font family

- font size

- font style

- font variant

- font weight

- font property shorthand

- text align

- text decoration

- line height

- color (in a few ways)

- border and shorthand

- padding and shorthand

- margin and shorthand
